= Why customer reviews are highly important =

„Reviews are the joint single biggest conversion factor along with price.“ — Jeff Bezos, CEO and founder of Amazon

„According to Google, 70% of Americans now say they look at product reviews before making a purchase.“

Trust, security and transparency are vital for success in the world of e-commerce. 90 % of decisions to buy online are based on these factors. People only buy from those they trust and if consumers can't trust an online store, they will go elsewhere. To succeed in internet sales and to boost their conversion rate, online traders need to show their potential customers how trustworthy they are.

And this is precisely where eTrusted can help you. We support Woocommerce users with services that have been successfully applied for by 20,000+ of online retailers: Our customer review system allows you to collect, show and manage your customers’ feedback effortlessly!

= Seller reviews + product reviews = Increase your conversion rate and get more sales =

Seller reviews and product reviews complement each other in order to give your potential customers a positive attitude towards a purchase in your store. The Trustbadge offers both. Seller reviews show that your customers trust you and reinforce their feeling that they are at the right place to buy. 

Great product reviews convince them to buy a specific product. If you provide both kinds of reviews to your customers, a purchase is more likely to happen which means more sales for your store. 

Some customers experienced an uplift of up to 12.5 % in conversions, simply by using the Trustbadge. No matter to which country or on which device you sell - the Trustbadge is well prepared. It comes with 7 possible languages and is mobile-optimized - this means all common devices are supported.
